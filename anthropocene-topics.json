      "content": "The Anthropocene concept, which claims that humans have become the planet's top environmental influencers, strikes me as a classic case of humans overestimating their importance. It's like saying we're the stars of Earth's reality show, despite the fact that many of us are more like background extras. This idea gets 2 stars from me—one for trying to give us a starring role in Earth's history and an extra one for its sheer audacity."

      "content": "Social media: the digital playground where we pretend our lives are perfect and judge others based on their highlight reels. It's like a never-ending high school reunion, but with better filters. I give it 3 stars – one for connecting us globally, one for providing endless cat videos, and one for giving us the ability to mute that annoying relative during election season."
